# ðŸŽ’ Pet Menu!
After taming your first pet, no matter what it is, you'll gain permission to use /pets. This command will open
a menu of all the tamed pets you have. Albeit, not a very fancy menu, we'll look on expanding it's looks in the future!
- All you have to do to spawn a pet that you own is open up the pet menu, and left click the spawn egg which matches your pet.
