# 🐇 Pets!
- At the point of writing this wiki, we only have three pets. However, we plan to implement so many more!
- Sugar Glider
- Lemur
- Turtle Duck
# 🍓 Pet Taming Basics!
Taming pets in BMC is essentially the same as taming any other tameable creature within minecraft. 
For example, you would feed a wolf meat to tame it. It's the exact same in BMC!
# What do the pets eat?
###Sugar Glider:
- Taming: 10 Sugar
- Leveling: Melons

- Taming: 10 Glow Berries
- Leveling: Sweet Berries

- Taming: 10 Bread
- Leveling: Wheat
### All of these pets can be levelled by entering combat, however it is highly advised against as they have low health pools.
