For example, you would feed a wolf meat to tame it. It's the exact same in BMC!

# Pet Experience!
Pet experience is gained through two different tasks at the moment. 
- #1: Leveling Food: All leveling food grants 1 pet exp. Each pet has it's own food that it needs to eat to level. Read above to learn more.
- #2: Entering Combat: Your pets will gain 2 exp everytime they enter combat. Albeit, it's not advised as pets have a low health pool.
