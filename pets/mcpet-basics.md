# üêá Pets!
- At the point of writing this wiki, we only have three pets. However, we plan to implement so many more!

# üçì Pet Taming Basics!
Taming pets in BMC is essentially the same as taming any other tameable creature within minecraft. 
For example, you would feed a wolf meat to tame it. It's the exact same in BMC!
The level-up food uses the exact-same right click mechanic as well!

# Pet Experience!
Pet experience is gained through two different tasks at the moment. 
- #1: Leveling Food: All leveling food grants 1 pet exp. Each pet has it's own food that it needs to eat to level. Read above to learn more.
- #2: Entering Combat: Your pets will gain 2 exp everytime they enter combat. Albeit, it's not advised as pets have a low health pool.

# Level Ups!
Levelling up pets increases all of their base stats significantly. At this point in time it also means that your pet gains an extra inventory slot!
