# 🐇 Pets!
- At the point of writing this wiki, we only have three pets. However, we plan to implement so many more!
- Sugar Glider
- Lemur
- Turtle Duck
# 🍓 Pet Taming Basics!
Taming pets in BMC is essentially the same as taming any other tameable creature within minecraft. 
For example, you would feed a wolf meat to tame it. It's the exact same in BMC!
