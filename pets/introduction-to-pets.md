# üêà Pets, Getting Started!
In the world of BMC, players can find all sorts of mobs across the world. Coincendentally, some of these mobs turn out to be pets üò≤.
These pets come in different shapes and sizes, ranging from exotic-common pets. Be on the lookout!

# Pet Types
- Companion Pets: At the time of writing this wiki, there are only three pets that are accessible to the playerbase. These are all companion pets, following the player whilst carrying inventory slots. More useful as a cute/fun emotional support animal!
- Combat Pets: Combat pets are a type of pet which help you within combat. There is technically a version of these in the game at the moment, called the "Drakeshadow Stalker", which can be summoned through the "Dragon Claw" item. These pets will help their owner in combat, typically with a higher level cap than something like a companion.
- Travel Pets: Travel pets are a type of pet which are precisely designed to help you get around. These pets are typically mountable and fast, whether they be flying or grounded.
# How do you obtain pets?
Pets in BMC are found pretty easily. At the moment of writing this wiki, pets will spawn within a specific radius of a player, every 10 minutes, with a 10% chance. This means you're guaranteed a pet at least every hour and forty-minutes.
In the future, we'll move to a biome-strict system, where the animals will only spawn in biomes which they would be seen in, in real life.
