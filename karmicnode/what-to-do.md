# ðŸ‘» Karmic Node

## Quest

Once you are teleported to the Karmic Node, speak to Aye Aye. Aye Aye will tell you that he needs help warding off the corrupted spirit world. 
By accepting his quest, 6 jade will be removed from your balance, and the Karmic Node will appear. 
If you ended up completing wave 10, head back to the Karmic Node and converse with Aye Aye. As a result of your great defense, he will give you
64 spirit shards.
After you've done all of that, head back to spawn and converse with Hei Bai. Hei Bai will inspect the spirit shards, and let you trade them in
for all the items which are obtainable through the Karmic Node. See more info in the items and drops section.

## Basics

The Karmic Node is essentially a large jade crystal. This crystal cleanses the corruption within the spirit world.
As a result, waves of mobs start swarming the crystal, trying to kill it and spread more corruption.
Your goal as the player is to protect the node at all costs. If the node dies, you've wasted six jade and lost out on a chance of some great items.

## Spirit Veins

The spirit vein is a green-vine shaped protector of the Karmic Node. After a certain period has passed, there is a chance that one of these spawn. 
By killing a spirit vein, you heal the Karmic Node for a decent percentage of it's health. Be on the lookout for one of these, as they are crucial
to reaching higher waves.
