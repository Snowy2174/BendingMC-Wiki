# ðŸ‘» Karmic Node
Once you are teleported to the Karmic Node, speak to Aye Aye. Aye Aye will tell you that he needs help warding off the corrupted spirit world. 
By accepting his quest, 6 jade will be removed from your balance, and the Karmic Node will appear.

# The Basics of the Karmic Node
The Karmic Node is essentially a large jade crystal. This crystal cleanses the corruption within the spirit world.
As a result, waves of mobs start swarming the crystal, trying to kill it and spread more corruption.
Your goal as the player is to protect the node at all costs. If the node dies, you've wasted six jade and lost out on a chance of some great items.
