# Spirits

There are currently 7 different types of spirits in the Karmic Node, each with unique abilities and models.

## Grounded Spirits

***Virulent Wisp***
- The Virulent Wisp is a spiritual mob which charges straight towards the Karmic Node.
- It's set on a direct path. If it reaches the node, it infects it, and does a large portion of health as damage.

***Enraged Spirit***
- The enraged spirit is a very basic spirit. Being on the squishier side, the enraged spirit has the quickest movement speed.
- Easily noticeable because of the flames it generates at it's feet, this spirit has three main abilities: firewall, smokebomb, and explode.
- Firewall casts a barrier around the spirit, doing ticking damage to anyone who decides to get close.
- The smokebomb is a projectile which is shot from the spirits arm. If it lands, it will blind the player for a short duration.
- Explode is a short range ability which is extremely self-explanatory. When cast, does an explosion effect.

***Frigid Spirit***
- The frigit spirit is slightly slower than the enraged spirit, however it does slightly more damage.
- Easily noticeable because of the snowflakes which generate at it's feet, this spirit casts two abilities: spiritbeam and iceblast.
- Ice blast sends a block of ice towards the target.
- Spirit beam sends a large spirit projectile straight towards the target, doing massive damage and causing a small explosion effect.

***Fractured Spirit***
- The fractured spirit is the tankiest and highest damaging spirit of all the grounded spirits, however it is the slowest.
- Easily noticed by the cracking blocks at it's feet, the fractured spirit castts two main abilities: earthblast and shockwave.
- Earthblast sends a block of grass towards the target.
- Shockwave creates a large shockwave which surrounds the fractured spirit, doing damage to any targets close enough to be hurt by it.

## Flying Spirits

***Enraged Flying Spirit***
- The enraged flying spirit is noticeable due to it's extremely spirity nature.
- This spirit casts two main abilities, being: spiritblast, and spiritnuke.
- Spiritblast sends a quick projectile of spiritual energy towards the target. If this lands, a thunderous effect follows.
- Spiritnuke sends an extremely large projectile towards the target. If this lands, a massive explosive effect occurs, temporarily blinding players.

**Fractured Flying Spirit***
- This spirit is noticeable due to it's firey nature.
- This spirit casts two main ablities, being: fireshots, and firecomet.
- Fireshots sends five quick blasts of fire towards the target.
- Firecomet has a very long charge up time. Whilst charging, the fractured flying spirit will slowly fly higher into the air. Once completely charge, a massive beam of fire will come crashing down towards the target. If it lands, it will have an explosive effect and do immense damage.

***Kamikaze Flying Spirit***
- This spirit is extremely self-explanatory.
- This spirit launches itself towards the Karmic Node, and explodes, doing the most damage out of any other ability that any spirit has.
