# ðŸ“œ Enchanting Scrolls

Scrolls are special items used on tools and armour with enchants and perform different actions based on what scroll you are using.

There are therefore three scrolls in total, each with a variety of abilities. The scrolls can be accessed at the bottom of the custom enchants menu, and do not use experience but require money to be purchased.

**White Scroll**: The capacity to prevent enchantments from destroying tools or armour

**Black Scroll**: The power to transform a random custom enchant into a book and remove it from your weapon.

**Spirit White Scroll**: In essence, like Soulbound, the capacity to retain an item's enchantment after death

All you need to do to use a scroll is open your inventory. Drop the scroll onto the chosen weapon or piece of armour by dragging it there.
