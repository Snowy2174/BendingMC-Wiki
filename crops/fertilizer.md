# ðŸ¦´ Fertilizer

When it comes time to harvest your crop (with a right click) your plant will drop a varying number of item, each time you harvest the quality of your produce is random, the crops will be a mixture of three tiers which increase in rarity: **Common, Uncommon and Rare**



## Fertilizer

There are currently 4 types of fertilizer.

* **Retaining**: this fertilizer contains gravel, flint and clay and gives your pot a chance to retain moisture overnight due to the large stone sizes, the only obtainable tier is the first
* **Speed**: this fertilizer contains bonemeal and rooted dirt and increases the nutrition in the plantâ€™s soil giving it _a chance to grow two stages overnight_ rather than the normal one, the first tier can be obtained through crafting and the second as a rare drop from fishing chests.
* **Quality**: this fertilizer contains rare compounds and natural hormones to allow the crop to grow to larger sizes and _increases the chances to produce a higher tier_, only the first tier is available and the second can be caught as a rare drop from fishing chests.
* **Yield**: this fertilizer contains powerful nutrients which promote the growth of a larger yield _causing the crop to drop more produce_ the first tier can be caught as an uncommon drop from fishing chests.
