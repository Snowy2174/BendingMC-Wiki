# üê¶ Crows and Scarecrows

Another challenge your crops will face is the threat of being damaged by crows, every day there is a random chance your crops will be attacked by these bird monsters, ruining your crop.

## Scarecrow

The only way you can protect your crop from this avian pest is the use of a scare crow, or in this case, a scare-melon-lord which will ward off all crows from attacking your crops in that chunk.

The scarecrow can be crafted with three sticks, one melon block and a piece of wheat using a workbench.
