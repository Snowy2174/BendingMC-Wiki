# ðŸŽ£ Fishing Rods

There are currently 3 obtainable fishing rod upgrades which are crafted using the previous tier and several items, these upgraded tiers increase attributes like the way bait can, but can be used in together with bait

* **Nature rod,** can be crafted with a normal wooden rod and four oak saplings slightly increases attributes like fishing speed and chance for rarer fish, found also as an uncommon drop from treasure chests
* **Iron rod**, created by reinforcing the nature rod with iron ingots, further increases speed and fish rarity modifier as well as adding a small chance for drops to be doubled
