# ðŸ¦ˆ Getting Started

Currently, a total of **14 new fish** have been introduced! Each new fish has three quality variants and these higher qualities of fish are both _worth more_ and are _less common_, with the exception of the vanilla fish which have one tier.

## Seasons

Each of the new fish are evenly distributed between the four seasons where most fish can be captured two of the four seasons with some exceptions, like carp and salmon, which are able to be caught in any season.

## Biomes

Fish are split into three categories based on biome: River fish, Ocean fish and Deep-Ocean fish, where they will only be found in their corresponding biome as well as fulfilling the other three conditions.&#x20;

## Time

Some fish have a preference for different conditions such as only appearing during rain and thunder or possibly only at night, dawn and dusk, these will be the much rarer fish that you can catch.
