## Using the Recipe Book

The recipe book displays all locked and unlocked recipes.<br>
Locked recipes will appear in gray, while unlocked recipes appear in full color.

Clicking on any of the unlocked recipes, if all ingredients are provided, will trigger a minigame.<br>
After successfully completing the minigame, the selected dish will be cooked.

## Unlocking Recipes

New recipes can be unlocked by collecting recipe scraps.<br>
Collecting those will unlock a random, unknown recipe.

Recipe scraps can be acquired by fishing, quests, and random loot found throughout the map.
