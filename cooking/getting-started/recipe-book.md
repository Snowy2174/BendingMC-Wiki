# ðŸ“– Recipe Book

## Using the Recipe Book

The Recipe book is your collection of all you've learned about cooking, it contains all known recipes as well as hints as to how many recipes you have yet to unlock, these locked recipes will be in grey whereas the recipes you've unlocked in full colour, when you perfect a recipe the preview will display the perfect version of that dish.

Clicking on any of the unlocked recipes, if all ingredients are provided in your inventory, will trigger a [minigame](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/cooking-dishes#the-cooking-bar).\
After successfully completing the minigame, the selected dish will be cooked and given to your inventory directly.

## Unlocking Recipes

You are able to unlock new recipes by collecting recipe scraps, these scraps are hints as to the recipes of dishes you've yet to unlock, right clicking a recipe scrap in your inventory will immediately unlock a recipe you don't already know.

Recipe scraps can be acquired by fishing, quests, and random loot found throughout the map.

Some special recipes can only be unlocked by defeating certain bosses. See more in the future.
