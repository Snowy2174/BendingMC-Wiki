# âœ¨ Mastery

## Mastery

Mastery describes how good a player is at cooking certain dishes.\


Each dish has its own mastery value that can be found in the [recipe book](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/recipe-book), and\
can be increased until the maximum value is reached.\


When the maximum value is reached, the dish will appear as mastered, which\
will unlock the ability for it to be cooked automatically.

## Mastery Progress

Successfully cooking a dish will increase its mastery value by 1.\
The dish will be fully mastered once the maximum value of mastery is reached.

### Autocooking

Once a dish is fully mastered, the [cooking minigame](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/cooking-dishes#the-cooking-bar) can be skipped by left clicking on the recipe in the recipe book.\
Note that autocooking will only cook normal dishes. Perfect dishes can only be obtained by playing the cooking minigame.
