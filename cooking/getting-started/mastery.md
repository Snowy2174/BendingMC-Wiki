# âœ¨ Mastery

## Mastery

Mastery describes how good a player is at cooking certain dishes.<br>

Each dish has its own mastery value that can be found in the [recipe book](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/recipe-book), and<br> 
can be increased until the maximum value is reached.<br>

When the maximum value is reached, the dish will appear as mastered, which<br>
will unlock the ability for it to be cooked automatically.

## Mastery Progress

Successfully cooking a dish will increase its mastery value by 1.<br>
The dish will be fully mastered once the maximum value of mastery is reached.

### Autocooking

Once a dish is fully mastered, the [cooking minigame](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/cooking-dishes#the-cooking-bar) can be skipped by left clicking on the recipe in the recipe book.<br>
Note that autocooking will only cook normal dishes. Perfect dishes can only be obtained by playing the cooking minigame.
