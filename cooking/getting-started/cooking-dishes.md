# üç≥ Cooking Dishes

## The Cooking Bar

After selecting whichever dish you'd like to cook from the recipe book, you can right click it to start the cooking process, it's very important not to burn it!\
Right clicking your screen whilst the arrow is in green will cause the dish to be cooked correctly, and most likely perfectly, the further away you are from green the lower the chance of cooking correctly becomes.

This minigame can be skipped after fully mastering a dish. See [mastery](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/mastery) for more information.

## Perfection

When a dish is cooked, there is a chance for it to be of perfect quality.\
Perfect dishes have stronger effects and taste much better than normal dishes.
