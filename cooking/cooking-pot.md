## Using the Cooking Pot

The cooking pot is the heart of cooking, and is how dishes are prepared.\
More can be learned by talking to the chef.

Right clicking on the cooking pot will open the [recipe book](https://bendingmc.gitbook.io/bendingmc-wiki/cooking/getting-started/recipe-book).\
The recipe book is used to select the dishes that will be cooked.
