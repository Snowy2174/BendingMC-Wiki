# ðŸŒŸ Distilling and Drinking

## **Distilling**

Some Recipes don't require distilling but those that do are known as spirits, distilling is done with a brewing stand

1. Place the bottles with ferment into the brewing stand slots.
2. Place glowstone dust to act as a filter on top into the brewing stand (The glowstone used to filter will not be consumed during the prosses).

## Drinking

The Amount of Alcohol inside the Brew will be applied to the player when drinking. Depending on the quality of it, that may have different effects.

* The Player may not be able to walk normally anymore, they will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight
* Effects like Blindness, Confusion, Poison etc. occur
* The Chat will be altered depending on drunkeness, many things players write may be incomprehensible, sometimes it seems senseless
* Is the Alcohol particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects
* After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting
* After Overdrinking the player may faint (Disconnecting)
